Taco is a simple task-management app with a little of functionalities. It has a add, update and delete buttons and that's all. It is created in purposes to populate my portfolio with works that I love and enjoyed in doing.
Basically, I worked with flask and specifically, flask-sqlalchemy for connecting the backend. This project is a study project, for me to understand how flask works, so I could reproduce it in another app.

Here is the main design.
As I said, we can add some tasks:

Or delete them as we want.
Also we can modify them:

That's all kind of. 
As a final note: why Taco? Because I hadn't have enough imagination for a better name, and I just took the first two letters from "tasks" and BOOM!, what a genius, a Ta-co...
Thank you for your attention!
Lovely, Max
